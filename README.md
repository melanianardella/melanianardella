# Hi there, I'm Melania 👋👩‍💻
Biomedical Engineering graduate on a journey into applied programming and real-world data problems.

### 💡 About Me
My background is in biomedical engineering, with a strong focus on medical device technology, machine learning and advanced signal and image processing. I’ve worked on projects involving sensor data acquisition, embedded systems, firmware development, and data analysis in both academic and lab contexts.

### 💻 Tech I’m using / learning:
Python · MATLAB · Assembly · Git · Signal processing · Embedded systems 

### 🌱 What I’m Currently Up To
I’m currently focused on reinforcing and reviewing the basics with *Python Crash Course*, recreating some of its projects with my own twists.  
I'm also exploring creative coding concepts inspired by *The Nature of Code*, as a way to apply code beyond traditional problem sets.  
I’m using GitHub to document this process and share my progress publicly.
